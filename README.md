# Cascading periods of language-related brain plasticity across early childhood

## About
This repository contains the code and data supporting the study *"Cascading periods of language-related brain plasticity across early childhood"* submitted on *BioArxiv*.

## Code

**To reproduce Figure 1**  
- `RegionwiseT1T2.Rmd` — Calculates and plots the region-wise T1w/T2w distribution for both macaques and humans.  
- `DepthT1T2.py` — Calculates and plots the depth-wise T1w/T2w distribution for both macaques and humans.  

**To reproduce Figure 2**  
- `macaque/human_ageeffect.Rmd` — Calculates and plots the developmental trajectory of T1w/T2w in macaques and humans. Also contains the subsampling code to replicate Figure S5.  

**To reproduce Figure 3**  
- `macaque/human_ageeffect_7layer.Rmd` — Calculates and plots the developmental trajectory across 7 depth bins of T1w/T2w in macaques and humans.  

**To reproduce Supplementary Figure 1**  
- `geodesic_SA.Rmd` — Plots the correlation between geodesic distance and the sensory-association axis for both macaques and humans.  

**To reproduce Supplementary Figure 2**  
- `RegionwiseMBP.Rmd` — Calculates and plots the region-wise MBP distribution in macaques.  
- `DepthMBP.py` — Calculates and plots the depth-wise MBP distribution in macaques.  

**To reproduce Supplementary Figure 3**  
- `R1.rmd` — Calculates and plots the regional distribution of R1 and its correlation with T1w/T2w in humans.  

**To reproduce Supplementary Figure 4**  
- `human_ageeffect.Rmd` — Calculates and plots the developmental trajectory in humans using geodesic distance as the ordering of the parcellation.  
- `human_ageeffect_7layer.Rmd` — Calculates and plots the developmental trajectory across 7 depth bins of T1w/T2w in macaques and humans using geodesic distance as the ordering of the parcellation.  

## Scripts
- `macaque/human_calculate_geodesic_distance.py` — Calculates geodesic distance for each species.  
- `macaque/human_T1T2.sh` — Calculates the T1w/T2w ratio for each species.  

## Derivatives
Includes all the data needed to run the code.
